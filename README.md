### My name is Pete, and I'm learning to create web, mobile, and iOS apps.
I have completed both a Flatiron Full Stack Web Development bootcamp, along with several independent courses on iOS development, React, and Vue JS.    Please feel free to reach out by creating a PR for this repo.  :D  Here is a sample of the things that I have and am still working on:

### Bootcamp Projects:

#### Stack Underflow

#### Glance Cast

### State Flags

Ever wonder what the state flag of Idaho looks like?  With this app, you're in luck!  A photo directory of every state flag in the US.  Built to practice working with TableViews.

### Bitcoin Price Tracker

A simple, single view app that reaches out to the CryptoCompare API to get the latest Bitcoin price in 3 currencies.  Practiced working with networking in Swift and iOS.

### Todo List App

Boring concept aside, but I built a Todo List app that allowed me to gain experience with Core Data, along with more TableView and Segue practice.
