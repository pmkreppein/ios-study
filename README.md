### My name is Pete, and I'm learning to create iOS apps.
See what I'm working on as I work through iOS Development training courses.
Below are some of the projects I have put together as part of my study.  Please feel free to reach out by creating a PR for this repo.  :D

Ever wonder what the state flag of Idaho looks like?  With this app, you're in luck!  A photo directory of every state flag in the US.  Built to practice working with TableViews.

A simple, single view app that reaches out to the CryptoCompare API to get the latest Bitcoin price in 3 currencies.  Practiced working with networking in Swift and iOS.

Boring concept aside, but I built a Todo List app that allowed me to gain experience with Core Data, along with more TableView and Segue practice.
